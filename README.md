### Javascript

1. Arrays :

```js
In JavaScript, an array is a data structure used to store a collection of values. These values can be of any data type, such as numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays. Arrays are ordered, meaning each value has a specific position, or index, within the array.
Key Points:
Zero-Indexed: The first element in a JavaScript array is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
Dynamic Size: JavaScript arrays can grow or shrink in size as needed.
Multiple Data Types: You can store different types of values within the same array.
Creating an Array:
JavaScript

// Using array literal syntax
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

// Using the Array constructor
const numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3);
Accessing Array Elements:
JavaScript

console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: "apple"
console.log(numbers[2]); // Output: 3
Modifying Array Elements:
JavaScript

fruits[1] = "grape";
console.log(fruits); // Output: ["apple", "grape", "orange"]
Common Array Methods:
push(): Adds an element to the end of an array.
pop(): Removes the last element from an array.
unshift(): Adds an element to the beginning of an array.
shift(): Removes the first element from an array.
length: Returns the number of elements in an array.
```

2. Datatypes

```js
The Concept of Data Types
In programming, data types is an important concept.
To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.
Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

In the car thre's an If statement:
if (True){
    Turn the engine
}else{
Car probleme...
}

var age = 18;                           // number
var name = "Jane";                      // string
var name = {first:"Jane", last:"Doe"};  // object
var truth = false;                      // boolean
var sheets = ["HTML","CSS","JS"];       // array
var a; typeof a;                        // undefined
var a = null;                           // value null means nothing

```
